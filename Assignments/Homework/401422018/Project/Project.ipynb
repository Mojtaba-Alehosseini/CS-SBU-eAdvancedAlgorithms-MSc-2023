        "At first I defines a function called `DailyNeeds` that calculates daily calorie needs and macronutrient distribution based on gender, age, weight, height, activity level, and goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The function `DailyNeeds` takes six parameters: `gender`, `age`, `weight`, `height`, `activity`, and `goal`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It assigns an activity factor based on the provided `activity` parameter. The activity factor represents the level of physical activity and is used to calculate the daily calorie needs. The possible activity levels are: \"sedentary\", \"lightly active\", \"moderately active\", \"very active\", and \"extra active\". The corresponding activity factors are 1.2, 1.375, 1.55, 1.725, and 1.9, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. It checks the `gender` parameter to determine the formula for calculating calories. If the gender is male (`'m'`, `'male'`, or `'man'`), it uses the formula `(10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age + 5) * activity_factor`. If the gender is female (`'f'`, `'female'`, `'woman'`, or `'w'`), it uses the formula `(10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age - 161) * activity_factor`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. It checks the `goal` parameter to determine the macronutrient distribution. If the goal is to \"LoseFat\", it calculates a new calorie value as 85% of the original calories. The macronutrient distribution is set to 30% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 40% protein of the new calorie value. If the goal is to \"GainMuscle\", it calculates a new calorie value as 115% of the original calories. The macronutrient distribution is set to 40% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 30% protein of the new calorie value. If the goal is to \"Preserve\" (maintain current weight), the new calorie value remains the same as the original calories. The macronutrient distribution is set to 50% carbohydrates, 25% fat, and 25% protein of the original calorie value.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The function returns the new calorie value, carbohydrates in grams (carbs_c) divided by 4 (since there are 4 calories per gram of carbohydrates), fat in grams (fat_c) divided by 9 (since there are 9 calories per gram of fat), and protein in grams (protein_c) divided by 4 (since there are 4 calories per gram of protein).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the code calculates the daily calorie needs and macronutrient distribution based on the provided parameters, such as gender, age, weight, height, activity level, and goal."
